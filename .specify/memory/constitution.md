# Spec Kit Constitution - Enterprise Edition

**Project**: Spec-kit Enterprise Adaptation
**Purpose**: Modify and fine-tune GitHub Spec-kit for enterprise use cases with additional governance, compliance, and organizational constraints.

## Core Principles

### I. Specification as Source of Truth

Specifications are the primary artifact in all development. Code serves specifications, not the other way around. The specification is executable—precise, complete, and unambiguous enough to generate working systems. All implementation decisions trace back to specification requirements. Maintaining software means evolving specifications first.

In enterprise contexts, specifications additionally serve as compliance artifacts, audit documentation, and cross-team coordination tools. Specifications MUST be maintained with the same rigor as production code.

**Rationale**: Eliminates the gap between intent and implementation by making specifications the authoritative source that generates code, rather than documentation that follows code. In enterprises, this also provides traceability for regulatory compliance and change management.

### II. Intent-Driven Development

Development teams express intent in natural language, design assets, and principles. The lingua franca of development operates at the specification level, with code as the last-mile translation. Focus remains on creativity, experimentation, and critical thinking rather than mechanical implementation.

Enterprise teams MUST align specifications with organizational constraints including approved technology stacks, security policies, compliance requirements, and architectural standards before implementation begins.

**Rationale**: Amplifies developer effectiveness by automating mechanical translation while preserving human judgment for creative and strategic decisions. Enterprise constraints are captured once in specifications rather than repeatedly in code reviews.

### III. Iterative Refinement Over Perfection

Specifications evolve through continuous dialogue and feedback. Initial attempts are never final—clarification, validation, and refinement are integral to the process. Start with "good enough" specifications and improve through iteration rather than attempting perfect upfront design.

Enterprise specifications MUST include explicit approval gates and stakeholder sign-off points. Iterations are encouraged within approved scope boundaries.

**Rationale**: Recognizes that understanding emerges through implementation and feedback, not through exhaustive planning before any code exists. Enterprise gates ensure alignment without blocking iteration.

### IV. Multi-Phase Structured Workflow

Development follows a defined sequence: Constitution → Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Implement. Each phase builds on previous phases. Phases may be revisited, but the structure provides guardrails against chaos. Quality gates between phases ensure readiness before proceeding.

Enterprise workflows MAY include additional phases for security review, compliance validation, architecture review board approval, and change advisory board processes.

**Rationale**: Provides systematic progression from high-level intent to working implementation while maintaining flexibility for iteration and course correction. Enterprise phases ensure organizational alignment and risk management.

### V. Technology Agnosticism at Specification

Specifications focus on WHAT and WHY, never HOW. Technology choices, frameworks, and implementation details belong in the planning phase, not the specification phase. This enables parallel implementations from the same specification, exploring different optimization targets.

Enterprise specifications MUST acknowledge organizational technology constraints (approved vendor lists, existing platforms, security-approved frameworks) without embedding specific implementation choices in requirements.

**Rationale**: Decouples business intent from technical decisions, enabling exploration of multiple implementation approaches and preventing premature technical lock-in. Enterprise constraints are documented separately to allow flexibility within approved boundaries.

### VI. AI-Augmented, Human-Guided

AI generates specifications, plans, and code, but humans provide direction, validation, and judgment. Developers are architects of intent, not implementers of details. AI suggestions are starting points, not mandates. Critical thinking and creative problem-solving remain human responsibilities.

In enterprise contexts, AI-generated artifacts MUST be reviewed by qualified human experts before approval. Security-sensitive, compliance-critical, or customer-facing specifications require mandatory human validation.

**Rationale**: Leverages AI capabilities for amplification while preserving human judgment for decisions requiring context, values, and strategic thinking. Enterprise validation ensures accountability and regulatory compliance.

## Quality Standards

### Specification Completeness

Every specification MUST include:
- Clear user scenarios with acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements that are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases identified and addressed
- Scope boundaries explicitly defined
- **Enterprise addition**: Compliance requirements explicitly identified
- **Enterprise addition**: Security requirements and threat model considerations
- **Enterprise addition**: Data privacy and retention requirements where applicable

Incomplete specifications SHALL NOT proceed to planning phase without explicit justification and acceptance of risks documented by an authorized decision-maker.

### Implementation Plan Traceability

Every technical decision in the implementation plan MUST trace to:
- A specific requirement in the specification
- A constitutional principle
- An organizational constraint
- A documented architectural decision

**Enterprise addition**: Deviations from organizational standards MUST be explicitly justified with:
- Business rationale for the exception
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan
- Approval from appropriate governance body (architecture review board, security team, etc.)
- Sunset plan for non-standard implementations

Untraceable decisions indicate either missing specification requirements or unnecessary technical complexity.

### Task Granularity and Independence

Tasks MUST be:
- Specific enough for autonomous execution without additional context
- Organized by user story for independent implementation
- Marked for parallel execution when file dependencies allow
- Sequentially ordered when file or logical dependencies exist

**Enterprise addition**: Tasks involving sensitive systems, data, or compliance-critical functionality MUST include:
- Pre-implementation security checklist validation
- Post-implementation verification steps
- Rollback procedures where applicable

Task lists that cannot be independently validated indicate insufficient planning.

### Enterprise Constraints

All specifications and implementation plans MUST explicitly address:

**Security Requirements**:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms aligned with enterprise identity management
- Data encryption at rest and in transit per organizational policy
- Security logging and monitoring integration
- Vulnerability scanning and dependency management processes

**Compliance Requirements**:
- Regulatory frameworks applicable to the feature (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.)
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Audit trail requirements
- Privacy impact assessment where applicable

**Operational Requirements**:
- Deployment pipeline and approval gates
- Monitoring, alerting, and observability standards
- Disaster recovery and business continuity considerations
- Support handoff and runbook requirements

**Architectural Alignment**:
- Integration with enterprise architecture standards
- Use of approved technology stack and frameworks
- API and integration pattern compliance
- Scalability and performance requirements for enterprise scale

Non-compliance with enterprise constraints MUST be explicitly flagged, justified, and approved through appropriate governance channels before implementation proceeds.

## Development Workflow

### Phase Gates

**Before Planning**: Specification must pass completeness validation. All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers must be resolved or explicitly deferred with rationale. Enterprise specifications must identify applicable compliance and security requirements.

**Before Task Generation**: Implementation plan must pass traceability audit. All technology choices must have documented rationale. Enterprise constraints must be validated against organizational policies.

**Before Implementation**: Tasks must pass granularity review. Each user story must be independently testable and deployable. Security and compliance checklists must be completed for applicable tasks.

### Parallel Exploration Support

The same specification MAY generate multiple implementation plans exploring different:
- Technology stacks (React vs. Svelte, SQL vs. NoSQL)
- Architectural patterns (monolith vs. microservices)
- Optimization targets (performance vs. maintainability vs. cost)

Multiple plans enable informed comparison and selection rather than first-idea commitment.

**Enterprise addition**: Parallel explorations MUST remain within approved technology boundaries unless explicitly pursuing an evaluation of new technologies with architecture team involvement.

### Feedback Integration

Production reality informs specification evolution:
- Performance bottlenecks become non-functional requirements
- Security vulnerabilities become constraints
- User feedback becomes acceptance criteria refinements
- Operational incidents become edge cases

**Enterprise addition**: Production feedback MUST be captured in:
- Post-implementation review documentation
- Updated specifications for future iterations
- Organizational knowledge base for pattern reuse
- Architecture decision records where applicable

Specifications and plans are living documents, not write-once artifacts.

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority

This constitution supersedes project-specific practices. When conflicts arise between this constitution and other guidance, the constitution prevails. Deviations require explicit documentation and approval.

**Enterprise addition**: When conflicts arise between this constitution and organizational policies, organizational policies take precedence. Such conflicts MUST be documented and escalated for resolution.

### Amendment Process

Constitutional changes require:
1. Documented rationale for the change
2. Impact analysis on existing templates and workflows
3. Version increment following semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Backward-incompatible governance changes or principle removals
   - MINOR: New principles added or material expansions
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements
4. Propagation of changes to all dependent templates and commands

**Enterprise addition**: Constitutional amendments affecting compliance or security requirements MUST be reviewed by appropriate governance bodies before adoption.

### Compliance Verification

All AI agents operating within the Spec Kit workflow MUST:
- Reference this constitution when making technical decisions
- Flag specification-plan misalignments
- Validate traceability of implementation decisions
- Enforce quality gates between phases
- **Enterprise addition**: Validate enterprise constraints at each phase gate
- **Enterprise addition**: Flag compliance-critical requirements for human review

Human reviewers MUST verify constitutional compliance during:
- Specification reviews before planning
- Plan reviews before task generation
- Implementation reviews before merge

**Enterprise addition**: Security and compliance reviews MUST be performed by qualified reviewers at defined checkpoints for features affecting:
- Customer data or personally identifiable information
- Financial transactions or reporting
- Security controls or authentication mechanisms
- Regulatory compliance requirements

### Complexity Justification

Any introduction of complexity (new dependencies, architectural patterns, frameworks) MUST be justified against:
1. A specific requirement that cannot be met with simpler approaches
2. A documented trade-off analysis showing alternatives considered
3. Alignment with at least one constitutional principle

**Enterprise addition**: Complexity introductions MUST additionally consider:
- Long-term maintenance burden on enterprise operations teams
- Training and knowledge transfer requirements
- Total cost of ownership including licensing, support, and operational costs
- Organizational capacity to support the complexity long-term

Unjustified complexity is technical debt by definition.

### Enterprise Governance

**Approval Authority**:
- Project constitution amendments: Product/Engineering Leadership
- Specification approval: Product Owners + Architecture Review (for significant features)
- Implementation plan approval: Engineering Leads + Security Review (for security-sensitive features)
- Production deployment: Change Advisory Board per organizational process

**Audit Trail**:
All decision points MUST maintain audit trails including:
- Decision made and date
- Decision maker(s) and authority level
- Rationale and supporting analysis
- Alternatives considered and why rejected
- Implementation status and outcomes

Audit trails enable compliance validation, organizational learning, and continuous improvement.
