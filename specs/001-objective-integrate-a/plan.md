# Implementation Plan: Claude Team Command Integration

**Branch**: `001-objective-integrate-a` | **Date**: 2025-10-08 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-objective-integrate-a/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Integrate a new `/provide-claude-team` command into the spec-kit workflow that automates the creation and delegation of tasks to specialized Claude Code agents. The command analyzes tasks generated by `/tasks`, intelligently assigns or creates specialized agents stored in `.claude/agents/`, and annotates tasks.md with agent mappings. The existing `/implement` command is modified to read these mappings and delegate task execution to the assigned specialist agents using Claude Code's native agent file switching mechanism. Agents are reused and evolved across features, with the system preferring to update existing agents with new capabilities rather than creating duplicates.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (matches existing spec-kit CLI implementation)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- spec-kit existing infrastructure (slash commands, scripts)
- Markdown parsing library (for tasks.md and agent file manipulation)
- File I/O and pattern matching utilities
**Storage**: File-based (.claude/agents/*.md for agent definitions, tasks.md for mappings)
**Testing**: pytest (consistent with spec-kit testing approach)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS) - same as spec-kit
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI extension to existing spec-kit)
**Performance Goals**:
- Agent assignment completion within 10 minutes for typical features
- Variable scale with graceful performance degradation
- No hard limits on task or agent count
**Constraints**:
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing spec-kit workflow
- Must not break existing `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement` commands
- Must use Claude Code native agent switching (not subprocess/API calls)
- Agent files must be reusable across features (no feature-specific IDs in filenames)
**Scale/Scope**:
- Variable task count (no hard limit)
- Evolving agent library over multiple features
- Hybrid multi-factor matching algorithm (keywords + file paths + tech stack)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Specification as Source of Truth
✅ **PASS**: Feature spec defines WHAT (automated agent assignment/delegation) and WHY (reduce manual agent management overhead). Implementation plan derives from specification requirements.

### Principle II: Intent-Driven Development
✅ **PASS**: Specification expresses intent at workflow level (automate agent creation and task delegation). Technical choices (Python, file-based storage, Claude Code agent switching) made in planning phase, not specification.

### Principle III: Iterative Refinement Over Perfection
✅ **PASS**: Clarification phase completed with 5 targeted questions. Specification evolved through dialogue to resolve ambiguities around delegation mechanism, matching strategy, failure handling, scalability, and agent evolution.

### Principle IV: Multi-Phase Structured Workflow
✅ **PASS**: Following prescribed sequence: Constitution → Specify → Clarify (completed) → Plan (in progress) → Tasks → Implement. No workflow violations.

### Principle V: Technology Agnosticism at Specification
✅ **PASS**: Specification focused on functional requirements and user stories. Technology choices (Python, Markdown parsing, file-based storage) made during planning phase.

### Principle VI: AI-Augmented, Human-Guided
✅ **PASS**: AI (Claude Code) generating plan, but human provided direction through clarifications and approved workflow progression. Critical decisions (agent switching mechanism, reuse strategy) validated through clarification Q&A.

### Enterprise Quality Standards

**Specification Completeness**: ✅ **PASS**
- Clear user scenarios with acceptance criteria (5 user stories with Given/When/Then)
- Functional requirements testable and unambiguous (FR-001 through FR-026)
- Success criteria measurable (SC-001 through SC-010)
- Edge cases identified (6 scenarios covered)
- Scope boundaries explicit (workflow integration points defined)

**Compliance Requirements**: ⚠️ **N/A** - Internal development tooling, no regulatory compliance needed
**Security Requirements**: ⚠️ **LOW RISK** - Local file operations only, no network calls or sensitive data
**Data Privacy**: ✅ **N/A** - No PII or customer data involved

### Implementation Plan Traceability
✅ **PASS**: All technical decisions trace to specification requirements:
- Python 3.11+ → FR-001 (slash command) + existing spec-kit language
- File-based storage → FR-011 (tasks.md annotation) + FR-006 (agent files in .claude/agents/)
- Hybrid matching → FR-024 (clarification Q2)
- Agent evolution → FR-005, FR-026 (clarification Q5)

### Complexity Justification
✅ **PASS**: Minimal new dependencies (Markdown parsing). Reuses existing spec-kit infrastructure. No unjustified complexity introduced.

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ **APPROVED** - All constitutional principles satisfied. Proceed to Phase 0 research.

### Source Code (repository root)

This feature extends the existing spec-kit project structure:

│   ├── speckit.provide-claude-team.md    # NEW: /provide-claude-team command definition
│   └── speckit.implement.md              # MODIFIED: Updated to handle agent delegation
└── agents/                                # NEW: Directory for specialist agent definitions
    └── (generated agent files: frontend_specialist.md, api_developer.md, etc.)

        └── (example agent files)

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project extension to existing spec-kit. New command in `.claude/commands/`, new agent directory at `.claude/agents/`, modified `/implement` command logic. No new project structure needed - extends existing slash command infrastructure.

## Phase 0: Research & Technology Decisions

### Research Areas

Based on Technical Context, the following areas require investigation to resolve implementation approaches:

1. **Markdown Parsing for Task Extraction**
   - Decision needed: Which Python library for parsing tasks.md?
   - Requirements: Extract task ID, description, file paths, [P] markers, dependency relationships

2. **Agent File Format & Structure**
   - Decision needed: Exact frontmatter schema and section structure for agent files
   - Requirements: Must reference templates/claude_code_agents/*.md examples

3. **Claude Code Agent Switching Mechanism**
   - Decision needed: How does Claude Code load different agent contexts?
   - Requirements: Must understand agent file discovery, loading sequence, context isolation

4. **Hybrid Matching Algorithm Design**
   - Decision needed: Weighting and combination logic for keyword + file path + tech stack factors
   - Requirements: Balance accuracy vs. performance, avoid over-fitting

5. **Agent File Update Strategy**
   - Decision needed: How to merge new capabilities without overwriting existing content?
   - Requirements: Preserve existing capabilities, maintain structural integrity

6. **Failure Handling & Dependency Tracking**
   - Decision needed: How to identify dependency chains vs. parallel independent tasks?
   - Requirements: Parse task dependencies, track execution state

### Research Output

Research findings will be documented in `research.md` following the format:
- **Decision**: [what was chosen]

### Quickstart

A quickstart.md will be generated demonstrating:
1. Running `/tasks` to generate task list
2. Running `/provide-claude-team` to assign agents
3. Inspecting tasks.md to see agent annotations
4. Running `/implement` to execute with delegated agents
5. Verifying agent files in `.claude/agents/`
6. Observing agent reuse in subsequent features

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 0 Execution**: Generate research.md with findings for all 6 research areas
2. **Phase 1 Execution**: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, and quickstart.md
3. **Agent Context Update**: Run update-agent-context script to register new command
4. **Ready for /speckit.tasks**: After Phase 1 complete, specification + plan will be ready for task generation
