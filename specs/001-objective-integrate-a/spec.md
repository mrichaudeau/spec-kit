# Feature Specification: Claude Team Command Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-objective-integrate-a`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Objective: Integrate a new /provide-claude-team command into the spec-kit project to automate the creation and delegation of tasks to specialized Claude agents.

Project Context:
This work is to be performed on a forked version of the spec-kit project. The goal is to add a new feature that enhances the existing workflow.

New Command Specification: /provide-claude-team

Placement: This command must be integrated into the spec-kit workflow to run after the /tasks command and before the /implement command.

File Location: The command's definition file should be generated within the ./templates/commands/ directory.

Input: The command will consume the list of tasks generated by the /tasks command.

Core Logic:

For each task, the command must either find a appropriate agent into .claude/agents/ directory  OR generate a dedicated \"Claude Code Agent\" specialized for that task's requirements (e.g., frontend, API, database).

The examples in ./templates/claude_code_agents/*.md should serve as a helpful reference for agent structure and capabilities, but they are not the only source of truth; the generation logic should be intelligent.

Generated agents should be created as files within the .claude/agents/ directory.

The naming convention for each agent will be based on their specialty: <specialty>.md. I don't want  <spec_id> for tracking because I want to be able to reuse already generated agents.

The command must formally attribute or map each task to its corresponding newly created agent by appending the tasks.md file with the agent's name (e.g., [frontend_specialist.md]).

Output: The command should output the clear mapping of tasks to their assigned agents, which will be consumed by the /implement command.

Modification to Existing Command: /implement

Input: The /implement command must be modified to accept the task-agent mapping produced by /provide-claude-team.

Core Logic:

The command's primary function will change from direct implementation to delegation.

For each task, it will now dispatch the implementation work to the specific Claude agent assigned to that task.

It must then receive the code generated by the agent and integrate it correctly into the project.

Updated Workflow:
The final, intended command sequence will be:
/specify -> /clarify -> /plan -> /tasks -> /provide-claude-team -> /implement"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08

- Q: The specification mentions delegating tasks to agents using the "Task tool" but doesn't clarify the exact delegation mechanism. How should /implement invoke specialized agents? → A: Use existing Claude Code agent file switching mechanism (load agent context before task execution)
- Q: When /provide-claude-team analyzes a task to determine the appropriate agent specialty, what is the primary matching strategy? → A: Hybrid approach: combine keyword matching + file path analysis + plan.md tech stack context for multi-factor decision
- Q: When an agent execution fails during /implement, what should be the failure handling behavior? → A: Continue with independent tasks: halt only dependent tasks in the same chain, allow parallel independent tasks to continue
- Q: The spec mentions a 10-minute completion target for /provide-claude-team (SC-001). What is the expected maximum number of tasks and agents this should handle? → A: Variable scale: no hard limit, performance degrades gracefully with increased task count
- Q: When an existing agent in .claude/agents/ partially matches a task's requirements (e.g., matches 70% of capabilities needed), what should the reuse decision be? → A: Always prefer reuse: use closest match even if <50%, and UPDATE the existing agent file to add missing capabilities for the new task

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Intelligent Agent Assignment (Priority: P1)

When a developer completes the /tasks command, they need the system to automatically analyze each task and assign it to an appropriate specialist agent. The system should either find an existing suitable agent in .claude/agents/ or intelligently create a new specialist agent tailored to the task's requirements.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables automated task delegation. Without intelligent agent assignment, the entire multi-agent workflow cannot function. This delivers immediate value by automating the manual process of creating and managing specialized agents.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running /tasks to generate a task list, then running /provide-claude-team and verifying that each task has an assigned agent (either existing or newly created) with appropriate specialization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tasks.md file with frontend component tasks, **When** /provide-claude-team is executed, **Then** the system assigns a frontend-specialist agent (reusing existing if available, creating new otherwise)
2. **Given** a tasks.md file with database schema tasks, **When** /provide-claude-team is executed, **Then** the system assigns a database-architect agent
3. **Given** a tasks.md file with mixed task types (frontend, API, database), **When** /provide-claude-team is executed, **Then** each task receives an agent matching its technical domain
4. **Given** an existing agent in .claude/agents/ that matches a task's requirements, **When** /provide-claude-team analyzes the task, **Then** the existing agent is reused rather than creating a duplicate
5. **Given** a task requiring a specialization not present in existing agents, **When** /provide-claude-team runs, **Then** a new agent is created with capabilities tailored to that task type

---

### User Story 2 - Task-Agent Mapping Persistence (Priority: P1)

After agents are assigned, developers need the task-agent mapping to be clearly documented and persisted so the /implement command can correctly delegate work to the assigned agents.

**Why this priority**: Without persisted mappings, the /implement command cannot know which agent should handle which task. This is essential for the delegation workflow and must work before any implementation can proceed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running /provide-claude-team, then inspecting tasks.md to verify each task has an agent assignment annotation (e.g., `[frontend_specialist.md]`), and confirming the format is machine-readable for /implement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** /provide-claude-team has completed agent assignment, **When** a developer opens tasks.md, **Then** each task line includes the assigned agent filename in square brackets (e.g., `[frontend_specialist.md]`)
2. **Given** tasks.md contains task-agent mappings, **When** /implement is executed, **Then** it can parse and extract agent assignments for each task
3. **Given** a task assigned to `database_architect.md`, **When** the mapping is written to tasks.md, **Then** the format matches: `T001: Create user schema [database_architect.md]`
4. **Given** multiple tasks assigned to the same agent, **When** the mapping is persisted, **Then** all tasks reference the same agent filename consistently

---

### User Story 3 - Delegated Implementation Execution (Priority: P1)

When a developer runs /implement, the command needs to read the task-agent mappings, dispatch each task to its assigned specialist agent, and integrate the generated code back into the project correctly.

**Why this priority**: This completes the multi-agent workflow by actually executing tasks through specialized agents. Without this, the agent assignments serve no purpose. This is essential for delivering the core value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting up tasks.md with agent mappings, running /implement, and verifying that tasks are executed by the correct agents (observable through agent-specific patterns in generated code or logs), and all generated code integrates correctly into the project.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tasks.md with task-agent mappings, **When** /implement executes a task, **Then** the task is dispatched to the Task tool with the assigned agent's context/specialization
2. **Given** a task assigned to `frontend_specialist.md`, **When** /implement delegates the task, **Then** the agent generates code following frontend best practices (React, TypeScript, etc.)
3. **Given** an agent completes a task and returns generated code, **When** /implement receives the output, **Then** the code is written to the correct file paths specified in the task
4. **Given** multiple tasks assigned to the same agent, **When** /implement processes them, **Then** tasks marked as parallelizable [P] can execute concurrently
5. **Given** sequential tasks for the same file, **When** /implement processes them, **Then** tasks execute in order without conflicts
6. **Given** a task execution fails, **When** /implement encounters the error, **Then** it reports the failure with context (task ID, agent, error message), halts only dependent tasks in the same dependency chain, and allows parallel independent tasks to continue execution

---

### User Story 4 - Agent Reusability Across Features (Priority: P2)

As developers work on multiple features over time, they need the system to reuse existing specialist agents from .claude/agents/ rather than creating duplicates, enabling a growing library of reusable agents.

**Why this priority**: Enhances efficiency and consistency by building up a library of proven agents over time. This is valuable but not critical for the initial workflow to function.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running /provide-claude-team on two different features with overlapping technical requirements, and verifying that the second feature reuses agents created for the first feature.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** .claude/agents/ contains `api_developer.md` from a previous feature, **When** a new feature has API tasks, **Then** the existing agent is reused
2. **Given** an existing agent's capabilities partially match a task's requirements, **When** /provide-claude-team evaluates the task, **Then** it reuses the closest matching agent and updates the agent file to add missing capabilities
3. **Given** multiple features using the same agent, **When** agent assignments occur, **Then** all features reference the same agent file
4. **Given** a task requires capabilities in a completely different specialty domain (no existing agent overlap), **When** /provide-claude-team analyzes the task, **Then** a new agent is created with a distinct specialty name

---

### User Story 5 - Agent Template Generation (Priority: P2)

When creating new agents, developers need the system to generate well-structured agent definition files following Claude Code agent conventions, with appropriate capabilities, behavioral traits, and response approaches based on the task requirements.

**Why this priority**: Ensures generated agents are high-quality and effective, but the basic functionality can work with simpler agent definitions initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by forcing creation of a new agent (e.g., for a unique task type), then inspecting the generated .md file to verify it contains proper frontmatter, purpose, capabilities, behavioral traits, and follows the structure of example agents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task requiring a new `payment_integration_specialist`, **When** /provide-claude-team creates the agent, **Then** the agent file includes appropriate frontmatter (name, description, model)
2. **Given** an agent is generated for API development tasks, **When** the agent file is created, **Then** it includes capabilities like REST API design, authentication, error handling, testing
3. **Given** a new agent is created, **When** the template is generated, **Then** it follows the structure of agents in templates/claude_code_agents/ (Purpose, Capabilities, Behavioral Traits, Response Approach sections)
4. **Given** template examples exist in templates/claude_code_agents/, **When** a new agent is generated, **Then** the system references these examples for structure but customizes content based on task requirements
5. **Given** multiple tasks share the same specialty, **When** the agent is created, **Then** its capabilities encompass all relevant task requirements
6. **Given** an existing agent is reused for a task with additional capability requirements, **When** /provide-claude-team updates the agent, **Then** the new capabilities are merged into the agent's Capabilities section without removing existing capabilities

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a task's technical requirements don't clearly map to any existing agent type or template?
  * System should analyze task description and infer the most appropriate specialty, creating a custom agent definition
  * If completely ambiguous, assign to general-purpose agent and log a warning

- How does the system handle tasks.md modifications after /provide-claude-team has run?
  * Agent assignments are annotations on existing task lines
  * If tasks are added/modified, /provide-claude-team can be re-run to update assignments
  * Manual edits to agent assignments should be preserved unless explicit re-assignment is requested

- What happens when an assigned agent file is deleted or moved before /implement runs?
  * /implement should validate agent file existence before delegation
  * If missing, halt with clear error message indicating which agent is missing and for which tasks
  * Suggest re-running /provide-claude-team to regenerate assignments

- How does the system handle conflicts when multiple tasks require incompatible agent specializations?
  * Each task gets its own agent assignment based on individual requirements
  * No conflicts - different tasks can have different agents
  * Only concern is parallel execution of tasks affecting the same files (already handled by [P] markers)

- What happens if .claude/agents/ directory doesn't exist when /provide-claude-team runs?
  * System should create the directory automatically
  * Proceed with agent generation as normal

- How does the system determine task-to-specialty mapping accuracy?
  * Uses hybrid multi-factor approach: (1) keyword extraction from task descriptions (e.g., "API", "frontend", "database"), (2) file path pattern analysis (e.g., src/api/* → api_developer), (3) technology stack context from plan.md
  * References existing agent descriptions for matching capabilities against combined factors
  * Defaults to general-purpose agent if confidence is low across all factors
