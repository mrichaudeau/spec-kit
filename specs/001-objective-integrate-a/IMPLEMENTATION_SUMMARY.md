# Implementation Summary: Claude Team Command Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: ✅ MVP Complete (32/54 tasks - All P1 User Stories)

## Core Spec-Kit Modifications

This feature modified the **core spec-kit codebase** to add multi-agent capabilities system-wide.

### Template Files Added (Source of Truth)

1. **`templates/commands/provide-claude-team.md`** (NEW TEMPLATE)
   - Template source for `/provide-claude-team` command
   - Complete command implementation for agent assignment
   - Implements 3-factor hybrid matching algorithm
   - Handles agent creation, reuse, and updating
   - Annotates tasks.md with agent assignments
   - ~200 lines of command logic

2. **`templates/commands/IMPLEMENT_MODIFICATIONS.md`** (DOCUMENTATION)
   - Documents modifications made to `/speckit.implement` command
   - Tracks all enhancements for agent delegation support
   - Includes backward compatibility notes

### Compiled Command Files (Generated from Templates)

1. **`.claude/commands/speckit.provide-claude-team.md`** (NEW COMMAND)
   - Compiled from `templates/commands/provide-claude-team.md`
   - Active command available system-wide
   - Invoked with `/provide-claude-team`

2. **`.claude/commands/speckit.implement.md`** (MODIFIED COMMAND)
   - Enhanced with agent delegation capabilities
   - Modifications documented in `templates/commands/IMPLEMENT_MODIFICATIONS.md`
   - Added ~85 lines for agent support
   - Maintains backward compatibility

### Directories Added

1. **`.claude/agents/`** (NEW DIRECTORY)
   - Storage location for generated specialist agent files
   - Agents are reusable across all features
   - Initially empty (populated by /provide-claude-team command)

2. **`.claude/commands/lib/`** (NEW DIRECTORY)
   - Reserved for future utility modules
   - Currently empty (all logic in Markdown commands)

## How It Works (System-Wide)

### For ANY Feature in Spec-Kit

**Old Workflow:**
```
/specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /implement
```

**New Workflow:**
```
/specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /provide-claude-team → /implement
                                              ↓                      ↓
                                         Assigns agents        Delegates to agents
```

### Command Usage

**Step 1: Generate agent assignments** (after /tasks)
```bash
/provide-claude-team
```

Output:
- Analyzes all tasks in tasks.md
- Creates/reuses agents in `.claude/agents/`
- Annotates tasks.md with `[agent.md]` tags
- Shows summary of assignments

**Step 2: Execute with agent delegation**
```bash
/implement
```

Behavior:
- Detects `[agent.md]` annotations
- Loads agent context from `.claude/agents/`
- Delegates each task to its specialist agent
- Reports which agent handles each task

### Agent Library Growth

Agents accumulate in `.claude/agents/` across features:

**First Feature:**
```
.claude/agents/
├── api_developer.md          (created)
├── frontend_specialist.md    (created)
└── database_architect.md     (created)
```

**Second Feature:**
```
.claude/agents/
├── api_developer.md          (reused + updated)
├── frontend_specialist.md    (reused + updated)
├── database_architect.md     (reused)
└── deployment_engineer.md    (created - new specialty)
```

Agents evolve over time as capabilities are added.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Decision

**Chosen Approach**: Markdown-based command logic (spec-kit pattern)
- All logic embedded in `.md` command files
- No separate Python modules needed
- Follows existing spec-kit conventions
- Commands execute via Claude Code's slash command system

**Rejected Approach**: Python modules in lib/
- Would have required `.claude/commands/lib/*.py` files
- More complex for maintenance
- Doesn't align with spec-kit's Markdown-first philosophy

### Key Features Implemented

**1. Hybrid Matching Algorithm**
```
Combined Score = 0.4 * keyword_score +
                 0.4 * path_score +
                 0.2 * tech_stack_score

If score > 0.3: REUSE + UPDATE existing agent
If score ≤ 0.3: CREATE new agent
```

**2. Agent Reuse Strategy**
- Always prefer reuse (even at <50% match)
- Surgically add missing capabilities
- Preserve existing capabilities (never remove)

**3. Smart Failure Handling**
- Halt dependent tasks in same chain
- Continue independent parallel tasks
- Clear impact reporting

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**:
- `/implement` works WITHOUT `/provide-claude-team` (original behavior)
- Tasks without `[agent.md]` annotations execute directly
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Testing the Feature

### Test on This Feature (001-objective-integrate-a)

Since this feature's tasks.md doesn't have agent assignments yet:

```bash
cd specs/001-objective-integrate-a

# Assign agents to our own implementation tasks
/provide-claude-team

# See agent assignments
cat tasks.md | grep "\[.*\.md\]"

# Execute remaining tasks with agents (if any incomplete)
/implement
```

### Test on a New Feature

```bash
# Create new feature
/specify
# ... (describe feature)

/clarify
/plan
/tasks

# NEW: Assign agents
/provide-claude-team

# Verify assignments
cat specs/###-feature/tasks.md

# Execute with agent delegation
/implement
```
